<p>

	Welcome to the ChiPy website!  There is a <a href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/chicago" class="reference">mailing list</a>. Check out our current <a href="/tribes/tribe/members/" class="reference">members</a> list.
Some of us like to hang out in the IRC <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/chipy" class="reference">#chipy</a> channel on irc.freenode.net.</p>
</p>

<p>
	Meetings happen in the downtown area (Loop) the second Thursday every month and in the Northern Suburbs every other month on the fourth Thursday.

    <h1>About</h1>


<p>
Note that ChiPy is not a formal organization. We collect no dues, elect no officers, and keep no roster. Signing up for the mailing list carries no obligation. Nor does showing up at the meetings. Nor, at least so far, does anything else we have done, although we always appreciate it when our presenters show up. (They usually do!)
</p>

<p>
ChiPy is made up of people of all levels of programming and Python knowledge. At every meeting we have had both beginning programmers, people who are just starting to use Python, as well as experienced Python programmers. Don't be intimidated about coming to a meeting.
</p>
