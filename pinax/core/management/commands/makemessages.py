Management command that allows to translate specific apps and projects
isolated from each other to prevent "monolithic" translation catalogues.

For Pinax we need to take care of two special locations:

- Pinax Apps (PINAX_ROOT/apps)
- Projects (PINAX_ROOT/projects)

Both will be ignored when running this management command.
