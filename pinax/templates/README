This directory contains sets of common templates that are shared
between the example projects that are supplied with Pinax.


SUGGESTED SIMPLE USE:

The settings.py must include TEMPLATE_LOADERS where "filesystem" is
designated before "app_directories" like this:

TEMPLATE_LOADERS = [
    "django.template.loaders.filesystem.load_template_source",
    "django.template.loaders.app_directories.load_template_source",
]

The TEMPLATE_DIRS is then set so that you pick up the project
specific templates, the Pinax common default templates and then
the app-specific templates defined within each installed app.
In your settings.py file that looks like this:

TEMPLATE_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "templates"),
    os.path.join(PINAX_ROOT, "templates", PINAX_THEME),
]
